# PyBank and PyPoll data parsing with Python
### Overview
###### PyBank and Pypoll were different projects; the first one was to analyze the financial records for a Company X base on the Profit/Losses results dataset provided by the financial department. The second project objective was to automate the votes counting process for a small rural town, based on the Voter ID, County and Candidates. The source dataset for both projects were provided as "CSV" files.
### Objectives
##### PyBank:
###### 1. To calculate the total number of months for the financial records.
###### 2. To totalize the net amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
###### 3. To calculate the average of changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
###### 4. To calculate the greatest in profits and the greates decrease in losses over the entire period, defining also the corresponding date and amount.
### Anslysis and Results
##### PyBank:
###### As a result, the program generates the following analysis as an "output.txt" file (stored on the "Analysis" folder) and at GitBash/Terminal screen:
  ```text
